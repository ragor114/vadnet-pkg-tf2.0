# Work in Progress!
*See dev branch for current status of development*

The idea is to adapt [vadnet](https://github.com/hcmlab/vadnet) to work with the newest version of python (3.10) and tensorflow (2.12) instead of tf1.x. Moreover, we remove the cmd files for command line usage (only on windows) for a package approach s.t. vadnet can be imported and used as a VAD system in any python project.

Thanks to [Liam Schoneveld](https://github.com/nlml) for previously adapting vadnet to Linux and Mac and providing a predict_audio script. This work builds on [his vadnet fork](https://github.com/nlml/vadnet).

# VadNet
VadNet is a real-time voice activity detector for noisy enviroments. It implements an end-to-end learning approach based on Deep Neural Networks. In the extended version, gender and laughter detection are added. To see a demonstration click on the images below.

# Platform

Windows

# Dependencies

Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685)

# Installation

`do_bin.cmd` - Installs embedded Python and downloads SSI interpreter. During the installation the script tries to detect if a GPU is available and possibly installs the GPU version of tensorflow. This requires that a NVIDIA graphic card is detected and CUDA has been installed. Nevertheless, VadNet does fine on a CPU.

# Quick Guide

`do_vad[ex].cmd` - Demo on pre-recorded files (requires 48k mono wav files)

`do_vad[ex]_live.cmd` - Capture from microphone and stream results to a socket

`do_vad[ex]_loopback.cmd` - Instead of a microphone capture from soundcard (loopback mode, see comments below)

`do_vad_extract.cmd` - Separates audio file into noisy and voiced parts (supports any audio format)

`train\do_all.cmd` - Performs a fresh training (downloads media files, creates annotations and trains a new network)

# Documentation

VadNet is implemented using the [Social Signal Interpretation (SSI)](http://openssi.net) framework. The processing pipeline is defined in ``vad[ex].pipeline`` and can be configured by editing ``vad[ex].pipeline-config``. Available options are:

```
audio:live = false                   # $(bool) use live input (otherwise read from file)
audio:live:mic = true                # $(bool) if live input is selected use microphone (otherwise use soundcard)
model:path=models\vad                # path to model folder
send:do = false                      # $(bool) stream detection results to a socket
send:url = upd://localhost:1234      # socket address in format <protocol://host:port>
record:do = false                    # $(bool) capture screen and audio
record:path = capture                # capture path
```

If the option ``send:do`` is turned on, an XML string with the detection results is streamed to a socket (see ``send:url``). You can change the format of the XML string by editing ``vad.xml``. To run SSI in the background, click on the tray icon and select 'Hide windows'. For more information about SSI pipelines please consult the [documentation](https://rawgit.com/hcmlab/ssi/master/docs/index.html#xml) of SSI.

The Python script ``vad_extract.py`` can be used to separate noisy and voiced parts of an audio file. For each input file ``<name>.<ext>`` two new files ``<name>.speech.wav`` and ``<name>.noise.wav`` will be generated. The script should handle all common audio formats. You can run the script from the command line by calling  ``> bin\python.exe vad_extract.py <arguments>``:

```
usage: vad_extract.py [-h] [--model MODEL] [--files FILES [FILES ...]] [--n_batch N_BATCH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            		show this help message and exit
  --model MODEL         		path to model
  --files FILES [FILES ...]		list of files
  --n_batch N_BATCH     		number of batches
```

# Loopback Mode

In loopback mode, whatever you playback through your soundcard will be analysed. Before using it please set the right output format for your soundcard. To do so, go to the ``Sound`` settings in the control panel, select your default playback device and click on ``Properties``. Most devices will now allow you to set a default format. Choose ``16 bit, 48000 Hz`` and press ``OK``.

# Insights

The model we are using has been trained with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It takes as input the raw audio input and feeds it into a 3-layer Convolutional Network. The result of this filter operation is then processed by a 2-layer Recurrent Network containing 64 RLU cells. The final bit is a fully-connected layer, which applies a softmax and maps the input to a tuple ``<noise, voice>`` in the range ``[0..1]``. 

Network architecture:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcmlab/vadnet/master/pics/network.png"/>

We have trained the network on roughly 134 h of audio data (5.6 days) and run training for 25 epochs (381024 steps) using a batch size of 128.
